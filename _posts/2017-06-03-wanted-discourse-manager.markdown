Since [Announcing the Release of the HospitalRun 1.0 beta](http://hospitalrun.io/blog/2017/05/announcing-hospitalrun-1.0.0-beta), we've had almost **1,000 downloads** of the [desktop build](http://hospitalrun.io/tryit) and many more have deployed the [server installation](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/blob/1.0.0-beta/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

Good news: people are starting to use HospitalRun.

Better news: we need your help.

- Use = a need for support
- A Need for Support = an opportunity to help
- An Opportunity to help = _you_ getting involved and invested in HospitalRun

# Join the project team!

We'd like to stand up a [Discourse](http://discourse.com) instance for user and installation support. To do that, we need someone in the community to commit to the care and feeding of said discussion board.

Ideally, we're invite someone to **lead** our user community management function. Maybe that's you.

If you're interested, let's talk. [Email me](mailto:joel@hospitalrun.io) or find me on the project [Slack](https://hospitalrun-slackin.herokuapp.com/). Find me at [@tangollama](https://hospitalrun.slack.com/messages/@tangollama/).
