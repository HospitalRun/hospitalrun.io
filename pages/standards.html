              Refer to the sections on reporting and escalation in this document
              for the specific emails that can be used to report and escalate issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Reporting</h2>
            <h3>Project Spaces</h3>
            <p>
              For reporting issues in spaces related to HospitalRun please use the email
              <a href="mailto:hello@hospitalrun.io">hello@hospitalrun.io</a>.
              HospitalRun handles CoC issues related to
              the spaces that they maintain. Project maintainers commit to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident</li>
              <li>to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation when required.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Foundation Spaces</h3>
            <p>
              For reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example,
              repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email
              <a href="mailto:report@lists.openjsf.org">report@lists.openjsf.org</a>.
              The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports
              and commits to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident</li>
              <li>to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation when required.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Escalation</h2>
            <p>
              The OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP).
              This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when
              a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC
              has not been properly handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP
              send an email to
              <a href="mailto:coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org">coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org</a>.

            <h2>Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.0</h2>
            <h3>Our Pledge</h3>
            <p>
              We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation
              in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
              body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
              gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
              status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
              and orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
              welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Standards</h3>
            <p>
              Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
              for our community include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
              <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
              <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
              <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>
              <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
              <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
              <li>Public or private harassment</li>
              <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission</li>
              <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Enforcement Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
              of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action
              in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
              offensive, or harmful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
              or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
              contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
              communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
            </p>
            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>
              This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces,
              and also applies when an individual is officially representing
              the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our
              community include using an official e-mail address, posting via
              an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
              representative at an online or offline event.
            </p>
            <h3>Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
              Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
              may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement
              at the email addresses listed above in the Reporting and Escalation sections.
              All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
            </p>
            <p>
              All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security
              of the reporter of any incident.
            </p>
            <h3>Enforcement Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
              Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines
              in determining the consequences for any action they deem
              in violation of this Code of Conduct:
            </p>
            <h4>1. Correction</h4>
            <p>
