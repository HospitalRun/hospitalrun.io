    - question: Can the current version be deployed in a production environment?
      answer: No, but it can always be used as a complementary system pending version 2. Currently, it is used in some African hospitals that need an offline-first solution. We recommend using it through Docker.
    - question: What does “production environment” mean?
      answer: Production environment is a term used mostly by developers to describe the setting where software and other products are actually put into operation for their intended uses by end users.
    - question: For future versions, will I need to restart the entire process again?
      answer: Yes, the installation system will be partly different. However, we will provide a data export/import system.
    - question: Do you need internet to use HospitalRun?
      answer: The software also works without any Internet connection. However, it is recommended to connect the computer to the Internet to automatically synchronize the database data.
