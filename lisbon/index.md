## Developers in Lisbon will save the world

Well maybe not, but we can surely make a difference.

This event is the time and place for you to be there and make a difference.

With great power comes great responsibility.

We're joining development forces for one day where we will give a boost to the development of HospitalRun.

        will be building the alerting framework — backend and frontend.
        Daniela is a web development engineer that loves to play with Javascript. She is always searching to learn something new and gain new skills. She loves running, dancing, and photography, which makes her relax and observe the world. She is an organiser of the require-lx meetup and a mentor of Coderdojo LX, an organization that provides free education to youths by teaching them how awesome programming is!

        will be migrating reporting services from the Ember frontend to the Node backend.
        Tom is a Software Engineer at YLD, who works on the core of Node.js, JavaScript, and writes code in many languages, from Rust to Haskell. An ardent connoisseur of facial hair products, Tom definitely wins the award for best beard at YLD. Once he has groomed to perfection, he also enjoys brewing his own beer (and obviously taste-checking it).
